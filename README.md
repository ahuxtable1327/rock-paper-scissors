# Rock, Paper, Scissors: Harvest Edition

## Overview
Project Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
    - DRY JavaScript
    - localStorage to persist data
    - Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
    - Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
    
 This project was designed to require a lot of thought and consideration for separating the data model and DOM. It utilized event bubbling and delegation which were necessary when dyanmically changing the data model, rather than hiding and showing the information. Refcaotring provided an even clearer idea of how to make the code dynamic and human readable.
